# File picker for OneDrive for Business

The OneDrive & OneDrive for Business file picker is a light JavaScript picker over the OneDrive REST API. It is designed to work with both OneDrive & OneDrive for Business and to have light dependencies. Check your [live demo](https://nuxeo.github.io/onedrive-file-picker/).

## Getting Started

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/nuxeo/onedrive-file-picker/releases) or build it from master.

You also need [jQuery](http://jquery.com/download/) in your page. The file picker was built with jQuery 1.8.0, it should work with lower version.

Then include jQuery and file picker scripts in your page :

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.0.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="onedrive-file-picker.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="onedrive-file-picker.css">
```

### Get your access token

You can follow the OneDrive documentation [page](https://dev.onedrive.com/auth/readme.htm) to obtain an access token. This part has to be done by your application, as the file picker needs an access token to work.

### OneDrive

For OneDrive just init the file picker with access token :

```
var accessToken = '...';
var picker = new OneDriveFilePicker({ 'accessToken': accessToken });
```

### OneDrive for Business

For OneDrive for Business, the file picker needs an access token and the resource url to access the api.

```
var accessToken = '...';
var baseURL = 'https://{tenant}-my.sharepoint.com/_api/v2.0'; // For example : https://nuxeo-my.sharepoint.com/_api/v2.0
var picker = new OneDriveFilePicker({ 'accessToken': accessToken, 'baseURL': baseURL });
```

### Open file picker and get selected file

Once you have your file picker instance, you can call `select` method to open it. The method return a `Promise`, if you're not familiar with it, see this [page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). Once user has selected a file or closed the picker, the `Promise` will be resolved.

```
picker.select().then(function(result) {
  // Your code here
});
```

You get an object with at least `action` attribute which could be :
* select  - When user has selected a file
* close - When user has closed the file picker without selecting a file
In select case, you also get an `item` attribute which contains the selected [item metadata](https://dev.onedrive.com/items/get.htm).

You can also catch error thrown from API, like unauthorized errors, with catch Promise method :

```
picker.select().catch(function(error) {
  // Your code here
});
```

The API error contains the textual portion of the HTTP status, such as "Not Found" or "Internal Server Error."
